  <p>We are one of the most influential agencies taking control of our nations youth mentoring movement.</p>

</article>
<p>Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) is a non for profit that started in New York City in 1904 with a mission to give children facing difficulties the opportunity to have one-on-one relationships with mentors that offer counseling and support to help change their lives for the better. We are one of the largest and oldest youth mentoring organizations in the US, serving over 100,000 children since our beginning.</p>

<p>There are currently 520,799 children living at or below the poverty level. Our cause helps 5,000 of these by providing a "Big" that can help them believe that their present situation doesn't have to be their future.</p>

<p>Our founder, Ernst Kent Coutler, was a court clerk that realized many young boys could be helped and guided out of trouble by caring, supportive adults. The organization started when he made his famous plea:</p>


<p>"There is only one possible way to save that youngster, and that is to have some earnest, true man volunteer to be his big brother. To look after him, to help him do right, to make the little chap feel that there is at least one human being in this great city who takes a personal interest in him, who cares whether he lives or dies. I call for a volunteer."</p>


<p>By the end of the day, 39 men had volunteered. By 1916, Big Brothers spread to 96 cities across the United States. We later formed from just Big Brothers, to Big Brothers Big Sisters when we added young girls and female mentors in 1921.</p>
